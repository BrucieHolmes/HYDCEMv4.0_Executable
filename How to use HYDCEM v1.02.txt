INTRODUCTION
------------------------------
HYDCEM (HYDration of CEMent) is a free-to-use software to simulate the hydration of various cements and cement-blends using a coupled C# and PHREEQC model.

C# is a object orientated language within the .NET Fraework in Microsoft
PHREEQC [1] (pronunced freek C) is an ion-pairing model written used to perform geochemical predictions between solids, liquids and gases at equilibrium.

The software provides templates for the analysis of cement while hydrating over time, by replacement or concentration and employes the CEMDATA 18 [2] thermodynamic database.
Only the front-end of HYDCEM, a C# form, will be visible to users.

Users simply decide 1) which analysis they wish to run, 2) input the oxide composition of the cement (and fly-ash and slag as required), 3) set the water-cement (w/c) ratio, curing temperature and Blaine fineness, 4) which output
is required (graphical and/or tabular) and 5) where to save the results.

HYDCEM is available by opening the executable on GitHub.

Details on the various analysis can be found in [3-7].

------------------------------
ACCESSING THE SOFTWARE
------------------------------
1. Install PHREEQC into the C:/ drive from the link below.
https://www.hydrochemistry.eu/ph3/phreeqc3.Installer.exe
Installing PHREEQC will allow the user to view the input file created after each anaysis
 
2. Download IPhreeqC (Windows COM 32-bit) from the website below
https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/PHREEQC/IPhreeqcCOM-3.7.3-15968-win32.msi
IPhreeqc is needed to couple C# with PHREEQC

3. Open GitHub using the link below
https://github.com/BrucieHolmes/HYDCEMv4.0_Executable

4. Download the GitHub Repository by opening <Code> (green button) and clicking 'Download to Zip'.
Save the *.zip folder on your PC.

5. Double-click on the setup.exe file to open the HYDCEM front end
Install the software and the HYDCEM application will be installed as a program (HYDCEMv4_WinPrototype) on your PC.
If you receice a 'Windows protected your PC' warning, select 'More info' and 'Run Anyway'.


------------------------------
HOW TO UNDERTAKE AN ANALYSIS
------------------------------
1. Starting from the left of the front end, select the analysis type (only one a time can be selected)
2. Input the oxide proportions of the cement/CSC
   2.1 If undertaking seawater, sulfate or a quaternary/LC3 analysis, input the required information.
   2.2 If undertaking a fly-ash or slag analysis, input the oxide proportions of the SCM.
3. Input the w/c ratio (0.5, 0.65, etc), temperature (in degrees C) and cement Blaine fineness (in m2/kg).
4. Select which output(s) and format(s) is required (graphical or tabular (Excel sopreadsheet)).
5. Under 'File Locations', there is no need to find the cemdata18.dat database if you installed PHREEQC into the c:\ and added it to the databased folder (this is the default location for the cemdata18.dat database, as shown)
6. Under 'File Locations', click the 'Select folder' to save the output, which will include the PHREEQC input file and spreadsheet (if selected), into the Data folder in the *.zip folder downloaded to your PC.
7. Click RUN to start the analysis.
The PHREEQC Input file and spreadsheet (if selected) will be saved in the Data folder.

Provided all necessary inputs are correct, the analysis will begin immediately.
